<h1 align="center">Authentication System Simulation</h1>

<p>Create a system login simulation that prompts for a password and displays an invitation only if the entered password matches a pre-defined value in the program. In case of an error, display an error message and request to retry the input. After 3 incorrect attempts, the program should display a message about an unauthorized access attempt and terminate. (For simplicity, use an int variable in the code.)</p>
